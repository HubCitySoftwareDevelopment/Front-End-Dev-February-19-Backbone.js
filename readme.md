<h2>Introduction</h2>

Hey engineers!

We'll be holding our inaugural meetup on February 19th at 6:30PM. The technical presentation for the evening will be on the Backbone.js library with a focus on design patterns involved in JavaScript MV* and MVC style frameworks. We will be building a simple "Online Arboretum" application during the presentation. We kindly ask if you would like to participate in the interactive development session to please bring your own laptop to code along. 

The meetup will be hosted at the Pharmedio office in Oak Grove. The address is 6641 U.S. 98 #200, Hattiesburg, MS 39402. We are located on the second floor. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please contact me at wes@pharmedio.com. 

Hope to see you there!
